# What

Playing with SolidJS and trying to build an app to track daily activity.

Stores all inputs and preferences **in-browser** with IndexedDB, so all the user data is persisted, and nothing is stored in an external database.

## Roadmap

- [x] Select activities (for now hardcoded ones) per day.
- [x] Allow to create activities, and store them in browser (`local storage`).
- [ ] Store all the day selections in-browser (`indexedDB`).
- [ ] Assign colors and other data to each activity
- [ ] Create a place to update data about each activity.
